WebAssembly (WASM) could bring a lot for IoT developpers. I am specially interested by its usefulness to upload in-device (or even in-sensor) processing steps so the data processing that can be adjusted where the data are produced throughout the life of an IoT project. For example, at the beginning you may want to send directly as much data as possible to analyse them and understand what they can say. You may end by having a good model to differentiate normal situations from abnormal ones and just want the device to send you an alert when needed.

 Should we start a proposal for a WASI interface dedicated to IoT systems ?
